# DV_PROJECT_DA-591_TEAM5
Course project submission

Overview:

This project focuses on visualizing air quality index (AQI) trends in selected cities using the Shiny platform with R integration. It utilizes a dataset (city_day.csv) containing air quality data for various cities.


Files:

Team5_DV_Project.R :  This R script contains the Shiny application code for visualizing AQI trends, generating plots, and analyzing the data.

Dataset: Th csv file named "city_day.csv" included in the google drive:

About the Application:

UI: The application UI allows users to select cities and parameters for visualizing AQI trends.

Plots: Various plots are generated, including bar charts for top cities with highest and lowest AQI, line plots for AQI trends, scatter plots for PM2.5 vs PM10, box plots for AQI distribution, and histograms for O3 distribution.

Analysis: Each plot is accompanied by a brief analysis providing insights into the data visualization.


Note:

Ensure that the 'city_day.csv' file is placed in the same directory as the 'Team5_DV_Project.R' script for proper data loading.
